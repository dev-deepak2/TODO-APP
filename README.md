I just completed a To-Do List app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
ðŸ‘‰ Key Features:
Custom Checkbox: Stylish interactive checkboxes to mark tasks as complete.
Persistent Data: Tasks are saved even after refreshing the page using localStorage.
Responsive Design: The app looks great on both desktop and mobile.
